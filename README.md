## USSD_with_js
# A USSD app made with javascript using Africastalking API
USSD stands for Unstructured Supplementary Service Data which is a Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) protocol that is used to send text messages.
Tried using this easy to use USSD API in making my own trial ussd.
